            Yeah
            Hmm

            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
            Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban town
            Long way, really long way from suburbia

            Small town love, fall down love, not medicated
            Drink too much, think too much, thoughts drownin' me
            I'm too high, please don't cry, stop doubtin' me
            You don't know love, you just show love, stop downin' me

            Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
            Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
            Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
            Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
            
            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
            Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban town
            Long way, really long way from suburbia

            Big dreams, yeah (yo), big screams, yeah (oh, yo)
            She's impressionable
            Hate to see, yeah (whoa), money scheme, yeah (whoa)
            Livin' questionable
            My friends drive (yo), new beamers (yo)
            Drop top convertibles
            Love hangin' out, say you hate it now
            Feelin' introvertical

            Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
            Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
            Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
            Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me

            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
            Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban town
            Long way, really long way from suburbia

            Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
            Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me
            Self-love, he don't love himself, tryna love me
            Cuff me, told the truth to him, he don't trust me

            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban towns
            Came to the city for the love, got her hurtin' now
            Oh my, she's a long way from suburban town
            Long way, really long way from suburbia

            In every other universe
            Gwen Stacy falls for Spider-Man
            And in every other universe it doesn't end well
            Well, it's a first time for everything, right?
